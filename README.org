* Introduction
** What is this and who is it for?

Just as Spacemacs and Doom Emacs are a combination of Emacs + Vim, this is my attempt at a configuration that combines Emacs + VSCode.

This emacs configuration allows you to use Org mode and still have access to "modern" keybindings.

Many of the keybindings are replaced with what I consider "standard" keybinds, like those you would find in Sublime Text, Atom and VSCode. Likewise, many of the features you would expect from some of these editors are also implemented here.

The goal of this configuration is to provide a comfortable experience editing Org mode files to programmers that are accustomed to modern text editors.

** Dependencies

In order for everything to work correctly, you should have the following installed on your system:

- ripgrep
- fd
- fzf
- aspell (or hunspell)
- git
- pandoc (or some other markdown parser)
- python
- vmd (node.js package)
- decktape (node.js package)
- some icon fonts

Some things like markdown and spellchecking have multiple alternatives available.

** Installation

Eventually, this config will work on windows but, for now, only unix is supported.

optional backup:
cp ~/.emacs.d ~/.emacs.d_backup

installation:
cd ~/.emacs.d/
git clone https://github.com/kyukee/emacs-config.git

then, inside emacs, open the command menu with M-x and run 'all-the-icons-install-fonts'

** Custom Keybindings

*WARNING*
Most of the keybinds are missing or out of date...
I'll do something about it eventually...


The conversion to use "modern" keybinds is mostly dealt with by [[https://github.com/darkstego/wakib-keys][wakib-keys]].
I customized the commands and changed a few keys but it's still similar to the default package.

The following image shows all the keys you need to know to get started:

#+ATTR_ORG: :width 1200
[[./config-resources/keyboard-layout-ctrl.png]]

The wakib-keys package defines a lot more bindings that are more oriented towars speed and productivity.
If you're interested, go check it out.

# How to modify layout images:
#  - go to http://www.keyboard-layout-editor.com/#/
#  - import json file
#  - make changes
#  - zoom in and take screenshot
#    - firefox screenshot tool can easily select correct area
#    - website export function exists but doesnt work verl well

** Fixes and improvements

Todo:

- [X] workspaces in dashboard
- [X] org mode: when pressing enter at the end of line that starts with '-', it adds two spaces
- [X] setting scroll margin messes up org indent mode. the first/last line sometimes appears unindented
- [X] change project name in the modeline (the name itself + its appearance)
- [X] change org source block header highlight color
- [X] home key should toggle between row 0 and first character in line (beginning and indentation, in emacs terms)
- [X] when line number is 0-9, and it changes to a greater value, the numbers column width changes and the whole buffers moves.
- [X] disable completion for plain text modes (org-mode)
- [X] config file should open with 2 levels of headings
- [X] add tabs like Sublime Text or somehow show tabs in current project
- [X] disable tab-line in dashboard
- [X] hidden tab-bar reappears when doing: M-x ESC
- [X] mode-line lighter for current indentation settings isn't there anymore
- [X] add icon to custom projectile doom-modeline segment
- [X] workspaces in dashboard icon
- [X] org-indent messes up hl-line-mode. it only has one face for the indentation. this creates a gap from line number to line. fix by changing bg of curr line number
- [X] background colour of org document keywords is not the same as normal background
- [X] ctrl+shift+left/right doesnt work
- [X] a hex color should count as a full word when selecting it (double click or C-S-left/right) (disable subword navigation)
- [X] selecting with S-<home> and pressing delete only removes indentation (untabify)
- [X] make alt+arrow work in org mode for headlines without shift (custom function)
- [X] use straight.el so only packages declared in the config file are loaded
- [X] compare latest version with old version in git. load time went from 0.7-0.8 -> 1.0-1.2 seconds.
- [X] package-quickstart needs to be deleted after package update or else there's an error. sometimes also custom.el
- [X] arrow indicating visual line doesn't appear

- [X] bufler groups show same file 2 times, in its own group and without a group
- [X] make C-backspace delete until first non whitespace character
- [X] make new line indicator appear only on right fringe
- [X] bufler workspace name in modeline doesn't fade to grey in inactive window
- [X] magit and dired buffers end up without  any bufler workspace
- [X] C-k should not copy to clipboard
- [X] make visual-regexp work with active region as input

- [X] query-replace with current selection as input (Replace+ package maybe?)
- [X] M-o isnt working for C-o and flyspell-correct
- [X] why does reloading the init file mess up doom-modeline (and why does it only happen in the currently open buffer)
- [X] when dashboard is opened with a hydra, the hydra menu stays open
- [X] for every package, use as much use-package integration as possible
- [X] C-backspace deletes previous word. it should only delete whitespace
- [X] swiper sometimes shows the match behind the modeline

- [X] C-l in a side window affects the left window instead
- [ ] add keybindings tables (or a cheatsheet image) in config file
- [ ] commenting/indenting inside source block jumps to top of block. happens with just 'emacs -Q' and comment-dwim ([[https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/ap4s7z/orgmode_weirdness_questions/][reddit thread]])
- [ ] maybe incorporate previous/next concept from wakib-emacs? (it uses the ';' key)
- [ ] use 'C-.' to fix any type of error (flycheck/flyspell)
- [ ] opening a new file in terminal or explorer should add a new buffer to existing emacs frame (maybe use emacsclient)
- [ ] allow C-page up/down to cycle when at first/last tab
- [ ] use C-S-page up/down to move tabs
- [ ] use smerge hydra for better merging conflict resolution (https://github.com/alphapapa/unpackaged.el#hydra)
- [ ] give every doom modeline segment a mouse-over description and menu (tooltip)
- [ ] improve appearance of tab-line arrows (they appear when the bar is too full)
- [ ] for every package, add a quote from their git repo explaining what the package does
- [ ] allow jumping to a function definition by ctrl-click or f2 or something else (check 'embark' package)
- [ ] when a region is selected and an arrow key is pressed in the opposite direction, exchange point and cursor (or make jump to prev mark work)
- [ ] add hydra or M-<key> commands for org-mark-ring-push, org-mark-ring-goto, counsel-mark-ring
- [ ] C-SPC and C-u SPC no longer work because of ryo-modal (C-SPC C-SPC to mark, C-u C-SPC to jump to prev mark)
- [ ] related to note-taking: check out deft, notdeft, org-roam, org-ql, org-rifle, org-journal, idutils
- [ ] use M-S-left/right to indent by 1 space (already works like that in org tables and lists)
- [ ] hydra toggle for golden-ratio-mode
- [ ] golden-ratio seems to be interfering with which-key
- [ ] try out =calfw= package
- [ ] magit diffs use blue and pink for additions and deletions
- [ ] make startup time under 1 second with use-package defer features
- [ ] reduce font size for hydra menus (should see menus even at 60% window width)
- [ ] crux has a lot of useful commands. I could replace my functions with their package.
- [ ] rainbow-mode gets overshadowed by current line highlighting
- [ ] electric-indent-mode in gitconfig-mode adds unnecessary tab after RET
- [ ] divide org-agenda NEXT section into sections based on different projects, and show warning if no NEXT action exists for a project
- [ ] can't customize emacs variables because of =wakib-keys= package
- [ ] open function help buffer -> click link to go to definition -> opens with cursor on top of function, at bottom of screen (org-link-frame-setup / find-file-other-window). Should open on top of screen instead.
- [ ] make 'my/indent-region-custom' function (M-arrows) work even in a blank line (could try 'indent-to' function)
- [ ] select region and press '(' to surround in parens; doesnt work in YAML mode
- [ ] diff-hl activation - global mode vs prog-mode hook


# NOTE: use org-sort and select 'X' to sort this list by what items are checked


add documentation:

- [ ] (in org mode) M-left/right -> promote/demote single heading; M-S-left/right -> promote/demote heading subtree
- [ ] C-RET and C-S-RET to make newlines (add keybinding docs)
- [ ] C-t "go to symbol", C-p "go to file" (add to keybindings documentation)


from sublime:

- [X] use vertical lines to signal indentation
- [X] markdown preview (in browser) asks you what flavour to use
- [X] diff files
- [X] file - reveal in sidebar
- [X] convert unicode to escaped string back and forth
- [X] open external terminal in current directory
- [ ] highlight vertical indentation of current scope / show bracket symbol in gutter (start and end of scope)
- [ ] show git untracked/unstaged/staged number in the modeline segment (also N of commits ahead/behind)
- [ ] bookmarks (C-F2 toggle, F2 next, S-F2 prev, C-S-F2 clear all, M-F2 select all)
- [ ] using git - compare file against commit
- [ ] C-- comment, C-S-- block comment
- [ ] snippet shows in autocomplete menu. just type and use tab for autocomplete. then use tab to jump in next snippet position
- [ ] notifications plugin
- [ ] C-F6 for spellcheck, F6 for next error
- [ ] jumping to start/end and PG-up/down all use scrolling


and also:

- [ ] look at vscode settings + extensions and import anything I like
- [ ] when this config is developed enough, see what it needs to work on Windows

* Early Init file
** File Header

Emacs HEAD (27+) introduces early-init.el, which is run before init.el, before package and UI initialization happens.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle early-init.el
;;; early-init.el --- Emacs Early Init File          -*- lexical-binding: t -*-

;;; Commentary:
;; GNU Emacs Configuration - Early Init

;;; Code:

#+end_src

** Start time optimizations

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle early-init.el

;; A common optimization is to temporarily reduce the frequency of garbage collection during initialization.
(setq gc-cons-threshold most-positive-fixnum)

;; FileNameHandler
(defvar file-name-handler-alist-original file-name-handler-alist)
(setq file-name-handler-alist nil)

;; Restore values after startup
(add-hook 'after-init-hook
  (lambda ()
    (setq gc-cons-threshold (* 16 8 1024 1024) ; 16MB
          file-name-handler-alist file-name-handler-alist-original)))

#+end_src

** User Interface

For the GUI changes that deserve to be in early-init. It is more efficient to disable UI elements before they are even loaded than to load them with the wrong configuration and then change them.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle early-init.el

;; Only show cursor in the active window.
(setq-default cursor-in-non-selected-windows nil)

;;Default frame position
(setq default-frame-alist
  `((height . 60) (width . 100)))

;; Prevent the glimpse of un-styled Emacs by disabling these UI elements early.
(push '(menu-bar-lines . 0) default-frame-alist)
(push '(tool-bar-lines . 0) default-frame-alist)
(push '(vertical-scroll-bars) default-frame-alist)

;; show column number alongside line number
(column-number-mode 1)

;; display relative line numbers
(global-display-line-numbers-mode)
(setq display-line-numbers-type 'visual)

;; highlight current line
(global-hl-line-mode +1)

;; avoid flashing the default emcas modeline while starting
(setq mode-line-format nil)

;; Do not resize the frame at this early stage.
(setq frame-inhibit-implied-resize t)

#+end_src

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle early-init.el

#+end_src

* Init file
** File Header

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle init.el
;;; init.el --- Emacs Init File          -*- lexical-binding: t -*-

;;; Commentary:

#+end_src

** Configuration file variable

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle init.el

(defvar *config-file* (expand-file-name "README.org" user-emacs-directory)
    "The configuration file.")

#+end_src

** Load config file
*** Method 1: tangle on save and load pre-parsed config file

After the first time that config.el is created, this will no longer tangle the config file.
This method is slightly faster than just using org-babel-load-file.

This is very effective when you have a hook to tangle the config file everytime you save it.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle init.el

;; If config.el exists then load it, otherwise tangle README.org
(if (file-exists-p (expand-file-name "config.el" user-emacs-directory))
    (load-file (expand-file-name "config.el" user-emacs-directory))
  (org-babel-load-file *config-file*))

#+end_src

*** Method 2: always parse config file on load

Always parse the config file when starting emacs.
This can be useful if recovering from errors in the config file is a concern.
The downside is that =org-babel-tangle= can take several seconds to complete.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle no

;; load config.el
(org-babel-load-file *config-file*)

#+end_src

** File Footer

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle init.el

*** Enable Debug while loading config

Enable debug mode before we make any changes. This makes is easier to figure out errors when they happen.
It only stays active while the config is loading.

(setq debug-on-error t)

;; disable debugging after startup
(add-hook 'after-init-hook

**** Package: pretty-hydra

nicer syntax for declaring hydras with use-package

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

(use-package pretty-hydra)

#+end_src

**** Basic usage

To install a package temporarily (until you restart Emacs):
  - M-x straight-use-package

To install a package permanently, place a call to straight-use-package in your init-file, like:
  - (straight-use-package 'el-patch)

To update all packages to their most recent version:
  - M-x straight-pull-all

A note about ":init" and ":config".
  - init is executed before a package is loaded (even if deferred)
  - config is executed after a package is loaded

*** Organize configuration directory
**** Package: no-littering

Make emacs configuration directory more organized and keep it clean.
'no-littering' should be loaded as early as possible since it changes where other packages will save their files.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

(use-package no-littering)

#+end_src

*** System Path
**** Package: exec-path-from-shell

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

(use-package exec-path-from-shell
  :config
  (exec-path-from-shell-initialize))

#+end_src

*** Startup Profiler
**** Package: esup

This isn't in the same section as the other features because it needs to loaded as early as possible to get accurate results.

One small issue is that it doesn't seem to load the early init file.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

(use-package esup
  :commands (esup))

#+end_src

**** Package: benchmark-init

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle no

(use-package benchmark-init
  :defer nil
  :config
  (benchmark-init/activate)
  :hook (after-init . benchmark-init/deactivate))

#+end_src

**** Basic usage

When using the profiler, just uncoment the line that disables the package.
Comment and uncoment that line to enable/disable the feature.

To see the results, run:
  - benchmark-init/show-durations-tabulated
  - benchmark-init/show-durations-tree

** Appearance
*** Font

Some of my font options:
  - IBM Plex Mono
  - Cartograph CF

The unit for the 'height' attribute is 1/10pt, which means a height of 100 is 10pt.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

(set-face-attribute 'default nil :font "Cartograph CF-12")

(custom-set-faces
  '(mode-line                  ((t (:family "Cartograph CF" :height 100))))
  '(mode-line-inactive         ((t (:family "Cartograph CF" :height 100))))

** Keybindings
*** Change default keybindings layout
**** Information

I don't like the default emacs keybindings, so I use some packages to change them.

Wakib changes emacs keybindings to be more modern and ergonomic.
This package should be near the top of the this file's features list, so there isn't any error when assigning keybindings to the wakib keymap.

**** History

Here's my adventure with emacs and keybindings:
I grew up with Sublime Text, Atom and VSCode and these all share a (mostly) common set of keybinds.
These are the keybinds I'm interested in using.
I tried standard Emacs keybinds for a short amount of time and I wasn't impressed at all.

Here's my history with trying to use "standard" keybinds packages in emacs:

- ergoemacs-mode
	At first I tried using ergoemacs-mode, but that created a lot of conflicts when my config grew in size as I added more functinality.
	I also had issues with reloading my config file.

- cua-mode
	Then I tried using cua-mode, but it wasn't "standard" enough to my liking.
	The way 'C-x' works in particular was a problem, since I would like to cut a whole line by default when I press C-x and there is no active region selected.

- manual bindings in config
	The next attempt was to bind every key manually in my emacs config file.
	This gave me a lot of control and knowledge over what exactly was happening in terms of keybinds, which I liked.
	It was almost perfect, but not quite there yet.
	I was able to set up all the bindings that are prefixed by Control and I was also able to bind C-x, C-h and C-g to '<menu> x', '<menu> h' and '<menu> g', respectively.
	The problem is that Emacs makes rebinding C-c quite difficult.

- wakib-keys
	I found out a package that was able to deal with the C-c rebind issue, and decided to just use it instead of dealing with all the trouble of rebinding C-c myself.
	Since wakib-keys override the global keymap binds, this involved transferring some of my keybinds to the wakib keymap (wakib-keys-overriding-map).
	It also adds some new keybindings for things that I didn't originally want, but that I think might be useful.
	Finally, I was able to achieve the behavior I wanted

**** Package: wakib-keys

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

(use-package wakib-keys
  :init
  (wakib-keys 1)
  :hook
  (after-change-major-mode . wakib-update-major-mode-map)
  (menu-bar-update . wakib-update-minor-mode-maps))

#+end_src

*** Global Keybindings

Here are keybinds that apply globally and don't depend on any package.
The ones that use functions from some package are defined in that package's section.

Some of these are slight alterations to wakib, such as modifying the functions of the keybinds.
Others add convenient things like zoom, reloading, fullscreen, etc.


*Navigating parenthesis*

A balanced expression can be a parenthetical group, a number, a word or a symbol. The precise definition of a balanced expression may depend on the current mode. Here is how to move from a balanced expression to another:

C-M-n     forward-list   Move forward over a parenthetical group
C-M-p     backward-list  Move backward over a parenthetical group
C-M-f     forward-sexp   Move forward over a balanced expression
C-M-b     backward-sexp  Move backward over a balanced expression
C-M-k     kill-sexp      Kill balanced expression forward

*** Directory local variables

It is possible to create directory-local settings without using a .dir-locals.el file or modifying the original file.
I prefer this approach because it is centralized and has less clutter.

This can be used to assign values to certain variables only to certain directories.
It is also possible set functions to evaluate at startup, for those directories.

For more information about syntax, check the [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Directory-Variables.html][documentation]].

** Additional Features

Add more features by installing emacs packages.

*** Icon integration
**** Package: all-the-icons

Allow Emacs to use icons in various UI elements.

Important: The first time this package is installed, you need to run 'all-the-icons-install-fonts' to install fonts.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

(use-package all-the-icons
  :config
  (setq all-the-icons-color-icons t))

#+end_src

*** Project Management
**** Package: projectile

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

(use-package projectile
  :config
  (setq projectile-completion-system 'ivy)
  ;; (setq projectile-indexing-method 'hybrid)
  (projectile-mode 1)
  :pretty-hydra
  ((:title "Project" :color teal :quit-key "q")
   ("Current project"
    (("f" counsel-fzf "find file")
     ("r" projectile-recentf "recent file")
     ("b" projectile-switch-to-buffer "switch buffer"))
    "Manage Projects"
    (("p" counsel-projectile-switch-project "switch to project")
     ("a" projectile-add-known-project "add a new project")
     ("d" projectile-remove-known-project "remove known project"))
    )))

#+end_src

**** Basic usage

To use a non-repository folder as a project, create a blank '.projectile' file in the folder to mark the project root.
See [[https://docs.projectile.mx/projectile/projects.html#ignoring-file]] for what to write in this file.

Quick version of what to write in .projectile:
'-' to ignore
'+' to keep and ignore everything else
'!' to override .gitignore

*** Workspaces
**** Information

Also called Layouts, Perspectives, Sessions.

What I want for this feature is to be able to save and load lists of files using workspaces.
Workspaces should be able to be composed of multiple items. Each item can be a project, normal folder or normal file.
I use the name 'workspaces' in this section, but it's interchangeable with other names for this type of thing in emacs.

Restoring the window sizes, positions and layouts is not so important for me.

Specific features I want:

  - when in a workspace, show list of open buffers, restricted to that workspace
  - cycle between all the buffers in the current workspace
  - save, load and switch workspaces
  - when switching workspaces, automatically prompt for file to open or go to last visited file
  - save or load a single workspace. each workspace has it's own file or section. it shouldn't be all or nothing
  - give workspaces a custom name
  - integration with dashboard package (needs a way of getting list of existing workspaces)
  - show current workspace in the modeline


Another idea I've had is the following:
  - whenever you enter a projectile project, the sidebar and tab-bar automatically show information from only that project.
  - for everthing else, the sidebar shows the current file's parent directory and the tab-bar shows all the non-project files.

*Keybindings*

Default keymap

| Keybind     | Action                                                                 |
|-------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| C-b         | switch to buffer in current workspace                                  |
| C-u C-b     | switch to buffer in any workspace                                      |
| C-u C-u C-b | switch to buffer in any workspace (and also set the frame's workspace) |
| <hydra> b b | show bufler workspace list                                             |

Inside bufler workspace list

| Keybind | Action                   |
|---------+--------------------------|
| ?       | show available keybinds  |
| f       | focus selected workspace |
| q       | close bufler window      |

Note: When you use bufler-switch-buffer, the first result is always the last opened buffer.
So you can use =C-b RET= to quickly return to the previously used buffer.

**** History

Packages I looked at:

- treemacs workspaces:
  + a workspace can only have projects or folders (but it's possible to use bookmarks for files)
  + Can not list all buffers in current workspace
  + can use projectile and bookmarks to cover some functionality

- eyebrowse:
  + does not save files, only layouts
  + works like i3 workspaces
  + the way it works is that you assign a workspace to a certain purpose and only open certain projects in there

- bufler (bufler-workspace-mode):
  + bufler-list is good for managing buffers. works like magit
  + the tab-bar integration is nice
  + does not save files
  + I tried to use desktop-save-mode for saving stuff, but wasnt very happy with it
  + bufler-workspace-mode allows to automatically switch workspaces when switching buffers
  + can use bookmarks to cover some functionality

- projectile + bookmarks:
  + needs a special file in a project directory to give it a custom name
  + it's not ideal for normal non-repo folders

- perspective and persp-mode (shared):
  + doesn't really have a concept of projects, only buffers
  + saves and loads all perspectives at once. on file load, all buffers from all saved perspectives are opened
  + persp-mode is more popular and supported, while perspective is simpler and nicer to configure

- perspective:
  + the list of buffers in current perspective works better than persp-mode

- persp-mode:

*** File Explorer
**** Information

Since I am using Treemacs workspaces I will explain my view on projects and workspaces.
Here is my ideal usage of workspaces/projects:

  - each project has a name that can be easily configured
  - a list of projects appears in the dashboard (with their custom names)
  - you can search all files in a project
  - the project name appears in the modeline
  - all of the previous items should also work with a standard folder (even if it's not a repository)

That last item is very important. It's the reason why I projectile by itself isn't enough.

This is a desired but not required feature:
  - no files are saved on project directory, or as few as possible. everthing should be saved in the '.emacs.d' folder

Taking this into account, projectile is a good start but it doesnt give me everything I want, so I'm also using Treemacs workspaces.

The sidebar only changes when bufler focuses a new workspace.

And here are some code samples from  the repo, showing some possibilities:

This time we want all of the above but a little more personalized. First off, let’s make bullets a little more chunky. Mind that the height we provide for bullet faces is not the actual height of a bullet, but its height relative to its surroundings. Additionally, let’s hide the leading stars for terminal sessions, as the default leader does not look all that good in my chosen terminal font. I make use of the fact that org-superstar-leading-fallback can be set to the space character. This has the nice advantage over org-hide-leading-stars that it does not just “paint over” the asterisks, but makes them completely indistinguishable from white space, neat!

Inline tasks behave as you would expect them to, for the most part. They have two bullets instead of one, but are otherwise treated the same as regular headlines by Org Superstar, meaning org-superstar-headline-bullets-list controls the bullet used as if it were a regular headline. If org-inlinetask-show-first-star is non-nil, you can customize the additional marker. Just like with the rest of Superstar’s decorations, you can more or less fully control how it looks, with independent settings for graphical and terminal displays and a dedicated face, should you find the default of using org-warn a little… unsubtle. We again use the LaTeX setup as a base and add a few tweaks.

try out a modal configuration

C-up gives error: "wrong number of arguments: (0 . 1), 2"
related to org-backward-paragraph
it works if I manually execute the use-package after emacs is loaded. probably a dependency issue.

after some experimentation, is seems there's a conflict with some org package.
Solution: load this package after the org section.

*** Emacs Completion Framework
**** Information

Helm and ivy are Emacs frameworks for incremental completions and narrowing selections.

Completion framework being used:

Ivy + Swiper + Counsel

ivy is the mechanism that handles all selection lists, narrowing
    them down using a variety of possible builders (regular expressions of
    flexible matching).  It also provides a base interface for any
    function that needs to receive input based on a list of candidates.

counsel provides a superset of functions for navigating the file
    system, switching buffers, etc. that expand on the basic features
    supported by Ivy.  For instance, switching buffers with Counsel offers
    a preview of their contents in the window, whereas regular Ivy does
    not.

swiper is a tool for performing searches, powered by Ivy, all while
    presenting a preview of the results.

#+end_src

**** Usage notes

- Using *reveal*

To export to pdf, open the HTML file in a browser and add the query string =print-pdf= to the end of the URL.

As an example, for a URL like this:
file:///home/user/Documents/presentation.html

The desired URL would be:
file:///home/user/Documents/presentation.html?print-pdf

Then use the browser to export the page as a PDF.
Follow the directions at https://revealjs.com/pdf-export/


- Using *decktape*

Another simpler option is to use the decktape cli utility.

Assuming you have it installed, run:
decktape reveal <my-file.html> <output>

*** Move Text
**** Package: drag-stuff

Moving text both horizontally and vertically.
I use the M + arrow keys for this. Since this interferes with org-mode, we use the default org-mode keybinds when the cursor is in an org-heading.

;; alt+up/down to move line or region

  ;; alt + left/right to indent blocks of text

  (defun my/meta-right-org-heading-detect ()
    "Executes a different function if the cursor is in a org heading.
Otherwise, just execute the normal behaviour"
    (interactive)
    (if (and (equal major-mode 'org-mode) (org-at-heading-p))
        (org-do-demote)
      (my/tab-region (my/get-buffer-indentation-size))))

    "Executes a different function if the cursor is in a org heading.

**** Usage notes

The color of a hydra is used to define how a hydra exits after executing.
The default color is red.

Behavior by color:

| color    | toggle                     |
|----------+----------------------------|
| red      |                            |
| blue     | :exit t                    |
| amaranth | :foreign-keys warn         |
| teal     | :foreign-keys warn :exit t |
| pink     | :foreign-keys run          |

As for naming conventions inside a hydra:
  - section names should be objects
  - section entries should be actions (performed on the respective object)
